# React
## JSX
JSX is a syntactic extension to regular JavaScript and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered in the React Document Object Model, or DOM. JSX is a declarative language that combines JavaScript with HTML. JSX  particularly popular in React applications, optimizes code performance by compiling source code into JavaScript that runs faster than its equivalent code written directly in JavaScript.

I have mastered:
-	Create a simple React page
-	Create, run and render a React application
-	Set properties for a react component


## Components
Components make the task of creating a user interface easier. The user interface can be broken down into several separate parts called components and combine them into a parent component that forms the final user interface. They can be reused and processed independently.
The main function of a React component is to render the user interface and update it whenever its internal state changes.
- In addition to rendering the UI, it manages UI-related events, such as a button component that has a click event.
- A state is an object that describes the behavior and display of a component at a given moment.
- A React component can be stateful or stateless.
- Stateful components are a class type, while stateless components are a function type.

Lifecycle methods are built-in React methods that work with
components throughout their entire stay in the DOM.
Higher Order Component (HOC) is an advanced React technique for reusing component logic.
This component is not a React component available in the API. This is a pattern that emerged as a result of the compositional nature of React. Essentially, HOC are functions that return components that are used to share logic with other components.
